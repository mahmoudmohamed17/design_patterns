Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows
objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
Common example when need to inegrate a 3rd party service or package
with a different interface from our code and don't have a direct
access to its source code, here we use it as a middle layer to work
as a translator between two interfaces.
